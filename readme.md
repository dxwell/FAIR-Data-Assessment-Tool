FAIR Assessment Tool
====================

This is an HTML file that allows a user to assess the 'FAIRness' of a dataset.

This is a fork off the ARDC tool at https://github.com/au-research/FAIR-Data-Assessment-Tool. 

This fork uses Bootstrap 4.0, a vertical questionnaire, JavaScript fixes, and modal content updates.

Installation
------------

Copy the file `index.html` from the html directory
to a server.
